# How Can I Join The Organization?

- We are working towards Github Actions where prospective members can join the organization without asking for an invite.
- For now, We request you to open an Issue in the Join_PatternHouse Repository with your credentials: Github Email ID, Github Username and any special messages and I shall personally send an invite to join the Organization!
